# AI-Powered Supply Chain Risk Analysis and Scenario Generation System

This project leverages cutting-edge generative AI models, including LLaMA and GPT, to optimize supply chain management through enhanced risk analysis and scenario generation. The system enables organizations to simulate potential disruptions and assess interconnected risks, driving more informed strategic decision-making and proactive risk mitigation.

## Key Features:
- **Generative AI-Powered Risk Analysis:** Uses LLaMA and GPT models to analyze unstructured data from global news, supplier reports, and other sources to detect and predict supply chain disruptions.
- **Scenario Simulation and Forecasting:** Generates diverse supply chain scenarios, allowing users to visualize potential outcomes and prepare for uncertainties.
- **Python and NLP Implementation:** Utilizes Python, NLP techniques, and advanced prompt engineering to refine model outputs and optimize decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used:
- **Generative AI:** LLaMA, GPT (for generating contextually relevant supply chain scenarios and risk analysis)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** SpaCy (for named entity recognition, text processing, and entity extraction)
- **Data Analysis:** Python (for model integration, scenario generation, and data processing)
- **Prompt Engineering:** Custom prompt designs for refining AI outputs and improving model accuracy

## Project Workflow:
1. **Data Collection & Processing:** Collect unstructured data from various sources (e.g., news articles, supplier reports).
2. **Risk Analysis:** Use NLP techniques to process and analyze the data, identifying risk factors, affected regions, and suppliers.
3. **Scenario Generation:** Implement generative AI models to simulate a range of supply chain scenarios based on the extracted insights.
4. **Strategic Insights:** Generate actionable insights for better strategic planning, helping businesses mitigate risks and optimize supply chain performance.
